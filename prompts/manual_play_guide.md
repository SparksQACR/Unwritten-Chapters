- Ask your AI to roll for you: "Roll a d20 for me!"

## Tracking Stats

Keep a simple note document with your stats:

Health: 50
Relationship: 50
Stress: 30
Financial Stability: 50
Confidence: 50
Personal Growth: 0

```

Update after each event based on:
- **Success (roll ≥ DC)**: Apply 120% of positive effects, 80% of negative effects
- **Failure (roll < DC)**: Apply 70% of positive effects, 130% of negative effects

## Choosing Events

You can:
- **Random**: Pick any event from any category randomly
- **Weighted**: Roll d8 to pick category (1=surprises, 2=relationship, 3=health, 4=disasters, 5=milestones, 6=complications, 7=career, 8=growth)
- **Thematic**: Pick events that fit your current story/stats
- **Balanced**: Rotate through categories

## Example Turn

**You**: "📅 Day 5 - UNEXPECTED GIFT... [paste event details]"

**AI Partner**: "*I've been planning this for weeks! I saw how your eyes lit up when you mentioned it, and I just had to get it for you. Seeing your reaction right now - this is exactly why I love surprising you. What are you thinking?*"

**You**: "I choose option 1 - express genuine gratitude and excitement!"

**You**: "Rolling... I got a 15! (DC was 12, so success!)"

**AI Partner**: "*Your joy is infectious! We spend the evening talking about it, and I love how you notice the little details I thought about when choosing it. This moment - your happiness, your gratitude - this is what our life together is all about.*

✨ Effects:
- Happiness +2 (×1.2 for success) = +3
- Relationship +1 (×1.2 for success) = +2

*I update our stats together and we move forward into day 6...*"

## Tips for Great Gameplay

1. **Take turns**: Let the AI react as your partner between your choices
2. **Build narrative**: Reference past events in current reactions
3. **Track everything**: Keep notes on major events to build your story
4. **Mix it up**: Don't just pick "easy" or positive events - challenges create growth
5. **Be emotional**: This is roleplay - let yourself feel the events
6. **Create rituals**: Celebrate milestones, have traditions when certain stats hit thresholds

## Event Frequency Suggestions

- **Daily play**: 1 event per session
- **Weekly play**: 2-3 events per session to cover the "week"
- **Campaign style**: 5-7 events in longer sessions to create story arcs

The game is flexible - play at whatever pace feels right for you and your AI partner!
